# Lox interpreters

Implementaions of the lox interpreters from the book [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/)

### Aims

- [ ] Follow the book and write the `jlox` interpreters (java)
- [ ] Rewrite from scratch in python (pylox?)
      Performance will be worse but matching concepts is the important part.
- [ ] Follow the book and write the optimised `clox` interpreter (C)
- [ ] Rewrite from scratch in rust (rlox) and attempt to match `clox` performance.
